# Configuration File for Queue Management
#
#
# This configuration file is automatically installed and configured with
# default values during Portal installation. You can edit this file to:
#   -- change the default values of the entries.
#   -- disable an entry by inserting a crosshatch (#) at the start of
#        the line.
#   -- enable a commented entry by removing the crosshatch (#).
# 
# Before you make any changes to this file, save a backup copy.
#
# When editing this file, follow the instructions in each section.
# For more information on the general syntax of configuration entries,
# see "Reference Guide to Portal Configuration Files" in the Portal
# online documentation.
#
# The entries below specify how this Portal process should manage
# transactions.

#
# To use one or more of these entries, remove the crosshatch (#) from the
# start of the line and enter a valid value or combination of values in
# hexadecimal format.
#
# For the main debugging entry:
#
#    1 = Print detailed error information.

#    4 = Print transaction tracing.
#
# For the front-end and back-end debugging entries:

# Use the suffix "K" to express the memory in kilobytes (units of 1024
# bytes) or the suffix "M" to express the memory in megabytes (units of
