#                          to the total.
#                  Tax   - 'Tax on tax' computation. Taxes are computed

#                  NCS   - Non-comulative standard tax computation. Taxes
#                          are computed based on the 'taxable amount',
#                          but are not added to the total.
#                  NCT   - Non-comulative standard tax computation. Taxes
#                          are computed based on previous 'taxable 
#                          amounts' and taxes, but are not added to the
#                          total.
