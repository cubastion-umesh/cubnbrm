#
# Lists all processes that are in one cluster.
#

# logmgr_pointer
#
# Specifies a pointer to Portal Manager.
#
# This is where Node Manager sends its log information. To use this entry,
# remove the crosshatch (#) at the start of the line and enter values for:
#
#     <host> = the host name or IP address of the computer running
#                Portal Manager
#     <port> = the port number of the computer running Portal Manager

# nmgr_logfile
#
# Specifies the full path to the log file used by Node Manager.
#
# You can enter any valid path.

# nmgr_name
# 
# Specifies the name or IP address of the computer where Node Manager runs.
#
# The name can be:
#
#    - (hyphen)                = Portal can use any IP address on the
#                                  computer running Node Manager.

#    <host name or IP address> = Portal should use a particular IP
#                                  address on the Node Manager computer.
#
# This entry is optional. If you remove or disable it, Portal
# uses gethostname to find the IP address of the Node Manager computer.

#========================================================================
# nmgr_port
# 
# Specifies the port number of the computer where Node Manager runs. 
#
# This number should be greater than 1000, unless you start Node Manager 
# as root. The default, 11970, is a commonly specified port for Node
# Manager.

# sec_enabled
#
# Enables security checking.
#
# The value for this entry can be:
#
#    0 = Node Manager does not check host or user names.
#    1 = Node Manager reads information about the authorized hosts and
#          the user name from the client file. Users can connect to Node
#          Manager only if their host and user names are specified in
#          this client file.

#========================================================================
# server_dep
#
# Specifies a list of processes on which a process depends.
#
# The list tells Node Manager to start the listed process before it starts
# the dependent process. For example, you must start the DM before you
# start the CM. For each dependent process, use this syntax:
#
#    - - server_dep <dependent_process> <process1> <process2> ..
#
# where:
#
#    <dependent_process> = the name of the Portal process, such as "dm1",
#                            that depends on other processes
#    <processN>          = the name of the process that must be started
#                            before the dependent process
#========================================================================

#========================================================================
# server_info
#
# Specifies pointers to the Portal processes you want Node Manager to
# monitor, such as the CM and DM.
#
# For each process, use this syntax:
#     - -  server_info  <process_name>  <program_path>  <working_path>
#                       <host_name> <port>
#
# where:
#  -- <process_name>: name of the Infranet process, such as "dm1"
#         CM: name must contain substring "cm" and no substring "dm"
#         DM: name must contain substring "dm" and no substring "cm"
#  -- <program_path>: path to the program executable for the process
#  -- <working_path>: path to the working directory for the process
#  -- <host_name>   : Host name where the server will be running
#  -- <port>        : Port number where the server is listening

#========================================================================
# start_servers
#
# Starts all Portal processes at startup.
#
# The value for this entry can be:
#
#    0 = You must start the processes manually.
#    1 = Node Manager starts all processes.
