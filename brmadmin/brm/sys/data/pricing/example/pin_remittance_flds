# Use this file to define remittance fields. A remittance field is an 
# attribute of an Infranet storable class used to define remittance 
# criteria. You define remittance criteria in the remittance 
# specification file. 
# 
# Loading this file into Infranet is a prerequisite for defining
# remittance specifications.
# 
# This file contains these reserved remittance fields:
# 
# service_type: The name of the service associated with the event. 
#      For example: /service/ip.
# 
# event_type: The type of event. For example: /event/session/dialup.
# 
# product_name: The name of a product associated with the event.
#      For example: IP Unlimited. 
# 
# profile_name: The name of a customer profile associated with an 
#      Infranet account. 
# 
# Do not remove or modify these reserved fields. 
# 
# You can create custom fields. A custom remittance field
# definition contains four columns separated by one or more spaces:
# 
# <remittance field name>   <base class>  <substruct>  <attribute>
# 
# For example: 
# 
# field Origination_gw   EVENT   PIN_FLD_CALL   PIN_FLD_ORIGIN_GW
# 
# Following is a description of each part of the definition: 
# 
# Remittance field name 
# ---------------------
#    The name you assign to the remittance field. This is the
#    same name you enter in the remittance specification file when 
#    you define criteria. Precede the name with the word "field."  
#    For example: "field origination_gw". 
# 
#    You cannot use a reserved field name for a custom field. 
# 
# Base class
# ----------
#    Enter one of these storable class names: EVENT, ACCOUNT or 
#    PROFILE. These are the only classes you can use to define a 
#    remittance field.
# 
# Substruct 
# ---------
#    Enter the name of a substruct that contains the attribute you're
#    using to define the field. This must be a valid substruct name 
#    as it exists in the Infranet data dictionary. In the previous 
#    example, PIN_FLD_CALL is the substruct of EVENT that contains 
#    the attribute PIN_FLD_ORIGIN_GW.
#  
#    If there are no substructs, specify NONE. 
# 
#    Arrays are not supported. You cannot use an attribute within an 
#    array.
# 
# Attribute 
# ---------
#    This is the name of the attribute as it exists in Infranet data 
#    dictionary
# 
#    In the previous example, PIN_FLD_ORIGIN_GW is the attribute and 
#    PIN_FLD_CALL is the substruct containing this attribute. 
# 
# Use the 'load_pin_remittance_flds' utility to load this file into
# Infranet. Even if you don't define any custom fields, load this 
# file to make the reserved fields available for your remittance
# specifications. Any time you modify this file, load the complete 
# file into Infranet again.
# 
# The load utility checks for the following:
# 
# *  that the four reserved fields exist
# *  that the base class name for each custom field is EVENT, ACCOUNT 
#    or PROFILE
# *  that the substruct and attribute names for each custom field 
#    exist
# 
# See the pin_remittance_spec file for a description of how to use
# remittance fields to define remittance criteria.
# 
# This is an example of a remittance field file with both reserved
# fields and custom field definitions:
# 
#fields (
#     service_type           RESERVED
#     event_type             RESERVED
#     product_name           RESERVED
#     profile_name           RESERVED
#     field Origination_gw   EVENT  PIN_FLD_CALL   PIN_FLD_ORIGIN_GW
#     field Destination_gw   EVENT  PIN_FLD_CALL   PIN_FLD_DESTINATION_GW
#     field Brand_name       ACCOUNT   NONE        PIN_FLD_GL_SEGMENT
#     field Profile_value    PROFILE   PIN_FLD_LDAP_INFO   PIN_FLD_DN
#     )
