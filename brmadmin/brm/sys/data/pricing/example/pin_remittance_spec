#======================================================================
# Use this file to specify rules for paying funds to service 
# providers and other third parties. Creating and loading this
# file is required to use the Infranet remittance feature.
# 
# This file contains one or more remittance specifications. Each
# specification defines the criteria that determine which third party
# receives remittance and specifies the product Infranet uses to
# calculate remittance when the criteria are met.
#
# The 'pin_remittance' application calculates the amount owed 
# to third parties for all events that meet criteria you define in
# this file. 
# 
#---------------------------------------------
# Prerequisites
#---------------------------------------------
# 
# Before creating and loading your remittance specification, you need
# to: 
# 
# *  Create remittance products, and include them in the appropriate
#    deals and plans in the Pricing Tool.
# 
# *  Create the accounts that receive remittance in Customer Center or
#    Administrator. 
# 
# *  Load the pin_remittance_flds file. This file contains the 
#    remittance fields you use to define criteria in your remittance
#    specifications.
# 
# See the Infranet online documentation for detailed descriptions of
# each of these prerequisites.
# 
#---------------------------------------------
# Defining Specifications
#---------------------------------------------
# 
# This remittance specification file must contain one or more
# remittance specifications for each third party that receives 
# payments from you. 
# 
# Each specification starts with ACCOUNT_BEGIN and ends with 
# ACCOUNT_END. Within each specification, include the following: 
# 
# Remittance account number
#-------------------------
# 
#    The account number of a third party who receives remittance. For
#    example:
# 
#    remittance_account_number   0.0.0.1-12554
# 
# Remittance type
# ---------------
# 
#    The status of an event before it can be included in the 
#    remittance calculation. You don't pay the third party its share 
#    of funds for an event until the event meets the status you 
#    define here.
# 
#    Enter one of these values:
# 
#    B: Billed. Infranet does not include the event in its remittance 
#    calculation until the event has been billed. 
# 
#    P: Paid. Infranet does not credit the remittance account until
#    the event that triggers the remittance has been paid and the
#    corresponding bill item closed.
#
#    A bill item is closed for online payments when you run
#    pin_collect and for non-online payments when you submit a batch
#    of payments through the Payment Tool. You might also close a 
#    bill item when you transfer amounts between bill items through
#    the A/R window in Administrator. 
# 
#    U: Unbilled. Infranet includes the event in its remittance 
#    calculation whether or not the event has been billed or paid. 
# 
#    For example: 
# 
#    remittance_type   U
# 
#    If you create multiple specifications for a single remittance 
#    account, those specifications must have the same value for 
#    remittance type. 
# 
# Remittance product
# ------------------ 
# 
#    The product used to compute remittance. The remittance account you 
#    specify must own this product. 
# 
#    For example: 
# 
#    remittance_product_name  Internet Access Remittance
# 
#    You can't use the same combination of account number and 
#    remittance_product_name in more than one specification.
# 
# Remittance criteria
# -------------------
# 
#    A set of one or more conditions that determines which events are 
#    included to calculate the amount to be remitted to the specified 
#    remittance account. 
# 
#    You can specify multiple sets of criteria for a single remittance 
#    specification. 
# 
#    The remittance criteria consist of: 
# 
#    <field name>  <operator>  <value> 
# 
#    where: 
# 
#    <field name>  is the name of a field from the remittance fields 
#       file. You can use any of the four reserved fields and any 
#       custom fields defined in that file. One of the reserved fields,
#       event_type, is required in each specification.
#
#       The reserved fields are: 
# 
#       service_type: The name of the service associated with the 
#       event. For example: /service/ip.
# 
#       event_type: The type of event. You must specify an event type 
#       as one criteria. 
#       For example: /event/session/dialup.
# 
#       product_name: The name of a product associated with the event. 
#       For example: IP Unlimited. 
# 
#       profile_name: The name of a customer profile associated with an 
#       Infranet account.
# 
#       Field names are not case-sensitive.
# 
#    <operator>  is one of the following relational operators: 
# 
#       =  equals to  (Can be used for numeric or string data)
# 
#       >  greater than (Can be used for numeric or string data) 
# 
#       >= greater than or equal to (string or numeric data )
# 
#       <  less than (string or numeric data )
# 
#       <= less than or equal to (string or numeric data)
# 
#       != not equal to (string or numeric data)
# 
#       contains  The field contains the specified value. This operator 
#          can only be used with string data. You cannot use any 
#          wildcards.
# 
#       beginswith  The field begins with the specified value. This 
#          operator can only be used with string data. You cannot use 
#          any wildcards.
# 
#       endswith  The field ends with the specified value. This 
#          operator can only be used with string data. You cannot use 
#          any wildcards.
# 
#       Guidelines for using operators:
# 
#       * For reserved fields, you can only use the = (equal 
#         to) operator.
#       * Operators are not case sensitive. 
# 
#    <value>  The value of the field that you want to check against. 
#       For example, /service/ip could be the value for the field 
#       service_type.
#  
#       Wildcards are not allowed within a value. For pattern matching 
#       of strings use the "contains", "beginswith" and "endswith" 
#       operators.
# 
#       Guidelines for entering values:
# 
#       *  Wildcards are not allowed.
#       *  Values are case-sensitive. 
# 
#       Here is a sample set of remittance criteria: 
# 
#    CRITERIA_BEGIN
#       field   service_type  =  /service/ip 
#       field   product_name  =  Product 1a - Internet Access 
#       field   event_type    =  /event/session/dialup
#       field   brand_name    contains  Brand 1 
#    CRITERIA_END
# 
#    In the above example, brand_name is a custom field, while the 
#    others are reserved fields. 
# 
#    If you have one set of criteria, an event must meet all the 
#    criteria in the set to contribute remittance funds to the 
#    account you specified. If you have two sets of criteria, an 
#    event must meet all the criteria in one set or the other, but 
#    not in both sets. 
# 
#---------------------------------------------
# Loading the Specification
#---------------------------------------------
# 
# Use the 'load_pin_remittance_spec' utility to load the remittance 
# specification into Infranet. Any time you modify this file, load 
# the complete file into Infranet again. After you load it, restart 
# the Connection Manager. 
# 
# The load utility checks for the following:
# 
# *  that all fields used for criteria exist in the pin_remittance_flds 
#    file and have been loaded into Infranet.
# 
# *  that all criteria include valid operators.
# 
# *  that event_type is one of the criteria defined for each 
#    specification.
# 
# *  that = (equal to) is the only operator used with reserved fields 
#    in the criteria.
# 
# *  that the remittance type is the same for all specifications that 
#    include the same remittance account number.  
# 
# *  that each remittance account exists in your Infranet system.
# 
# *  that each combination of remittance account and remittance product  
#    name is unique across all specifications in this file.
# 
#---------------------------------------------
# Examples of Remittance Specifications
#---------------------------------------------
# 
# Example 1: Specification with one set of criteria
# ------------------------------------------------- 
# 
# ACCOUNT_BEGIN
# 
#   remittance_account_number  0.0.0.1-12574
#   remittance_type  U
#   remittance_product_name   Remittance Product
# 
#   CRITERIA_BEGIN
#     field  service_type     =   /service/ip 
#     field  product_name     =  IP unlimited 
#     field  event_type       =  /event/session/ipt/call
#     field  destination_gw   =  120.255.412.322
#     field  origin_phone_no  beginswith  408
#   CRITERIA_END
# 
# ACCOUNT_END
# 
# 
# Infranet evaluates the criteria in the previous example as follows:
# 
# if service_type = /service/ip and
#    product_name = IP unlimited and
#    event_type   = /event/session/ipt/call and
#    destination_gw = 120.255.412.322 and
#    origin_phone_no beginswith 408 
# 
# then
#   the event shall be remitted to 0.0.0.1-12574  using
#   the remittance product IP unlimited
# 
# Example 2: Specification with two sets of criteria
# --------------------------------------------------
#  
# To specify multiple sets of criteria for the same account, create
# additional blocks of CRITERIA_BEGIN and CRITERIA_END within
# ACCOUNT_BEGIN and ACCOUNT_END. For example:
# 
# ACCOUNT_BEGIN
# 
#   remittance_account_number  0.0.0.1-12574
#   remittance_type            U
#   remittance_product_name    IP long distance remittance
# 
#   CRITERIA_BEGIN
#     field  service_type    =   /service/ip 
#     field  product_name    =   IP unlimited 
#     field  event_type      =   /event/session/ipt/call
#     field  origination_gw  !=  120.255.412.322
#     field  destination_gw  =   120.255.412.322
#   CRITERIA_END
# 
#   CRITERIA_BEGIN
#     field  service_type    =   /service/ip 
#     field  product_name    =   IP unlimited 
#     field  event_type      =   /event/session/ipt/call
#     field  origination_gw  =   120.255.412.322
#     field  destination_gw  !=  120.255.412.322
#   CRITERIA_END
# 
# ACCOUNT_END
# 
# Infranet evaluates the criteria in the previous example as follows:
# 
# if ( service_type   =  /service/ip AND
#      product_name   =  IP unlimited AND
#      event_type     =  /event/session/ipt/call AND
#      destination_gw =  120.255.412.322 
#      origination_gw != 120.255.412.322  )
# 
# or ( service_type   =  /service/ip AND
#      product_name   =  IP unlimited AND
#      event_type     =  /event/session/ipt/call AND
#      destination_gw != 120.255.412.322 
#      origination_gw =  120.255.412.322  )
# 
# then
#    the event shall be remitted to 0.0.0.1-12574 using
#    the remittance product IP unlimited
