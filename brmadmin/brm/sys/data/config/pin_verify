# Use this file to specify the types of customer authentication and 
# authorization failures you want to record. This file contains a list 
# of predefined failures. You can specify which of these events you 
# want to record and edit their descriptions. You can also add new 
# customized events to the list. 
#
# You can also record successful events, but doing this slows 
# Infranet performance.
# 
# After editing this file, run the 'load_pin_verify' application 
# to create the new config/verify storable object and load the 
# information in this file into the database. Then restart the 
# Connection Manager.
#
# The failure description is returned in the return flist of the 
# PCM_OP_ACT_FIND_VERIFY opcode, in the PIN_FLD_DESCR field. You 
# can view log-in failures by searching for events of the type 
# /event/activity/verify in the Event Browser.
#
# To later change your preferences, edit this file, re-run
# 'load_pin_verify', and restart the Connection Manager.
#
# Use the following syntax to specify log-in failures you want to 
# record:
#
# <type>  <yes/no flag>  <description>
#
# Where:
#
# <type> is a unique number that identifies a specific type 
#      of log-in failure. This file already contains types 0 
#      through 8, which are predefined failure events. Use types 
#      greater than 100000 to add custom failure types. The type 
#      appears when you display a verification event in the Event 
#      Browser.
#
# <yes/no flag> indicates whether or not the system records the 
#      failure. Set this flag to 0 for No or to 1 for Yes.  
#
# <description> is a message describing the specific log-in failure. 
#      This message appears when you display a verification event in 
#      the Event Browser.
#
# This is an example of a custom failure type:
#
# 100001	1	Application-Specific Failure
