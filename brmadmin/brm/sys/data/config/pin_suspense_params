# Description:
# 	Use this file to define suspenes parameters
#	The text data defined in this file will be loaded into the 
#	/config/suspense_params. 
#
# 	Loading this file will replace existing object with the one 
#	defined below.
#
# 	Use the following syntax for defining the suspense paramters
#	ParamName  ParamValue ParamDescription
#
#	ParamName                   ParamValue      ParamDescription
# 	max_transaction_size        100000          maximum transaction size
# 	deferred_delete_duration    0               used to defer the deletes
#      
#       Note #1: max_transaction_size must not be configured to negative value.
#       Zero "0" value of max_transaction_size parameter means user
#       wants everything to be commited in one transaction. The request will
#       not be broken into multiple transaction if value of this parameter 
#       is 0. 
#
#       Note #2: deferred_delete_duration (in seconds) is used defer the deletes 
#       till Revenue Assurance processes the revenue impacts of writeoff operation. 
#       Value of this should be zero ( is also the default value) if RA is not 
#       used, else recommended value is 604800 seconds (7 days)
#
#       Param name and value must be a single word and can not contain 
#       any spaces
#
#	Duplicate params in this file will cause an error 
#	the file will not be loaded into the configuration object.
