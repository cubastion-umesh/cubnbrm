# Use this file to map the events (that have no balance impacts)
# to not be recorded into Infranet, when they occur.
# 
# After defining the events and the flag values,
# run the 'load_pin_event_record_map' utility to create the new 
# /config/event_record_map storable object and load this notification 
# list into the Infranet database. Then restart the Connection Manager 
# for these changes to take effect. The config object is cached at 
# Connection Manager startup time. When any event occurs, PCM_OP_ACT_USAGE
# would check the event type against the cache and not record the event, 
# if it was configured to not be recorded.
#
# Use the following syntax for defining event notification:
# (One line for one record)
#
# <event_type>:  <flag>
#
# Where:
#  <event_type> is the event_type string. This is the POID_TYPE for
#       the event. Make sure that you do not
#	set /event/session for not recording. This event is ususally
#	recorded on LOGIN (or START-SESSION) (eg., start testnap or 
#	start Customer Center, etc). The same event (event that is 
#	created on LOGIN) is updated when you LOGOUT (or END-SESSION)
#	(eg., quit Testnap or Quit Customer Center, etc). If you 
#	configure this event for not recording, on LOGIN (or START-SESSION),
#	the event would not be recorded and when you LOGOUT (or END-SESSION),
#	it will throw an error when it attempts to update the same event.
#	This error, however, can be ignored. If you have cases where the
#	same event would be updated again, do not configure those events
#	for not recording.
#  <flag> is a integer value of 0 or 1.
#       If value is 0, then the event for event_type would not be recorded.
#       If value is 1, then the event for event_type would be recorded.
#
#======================================================================
# As explained in <event_type> above, event session is never to be 
# configured for not recording, so the following entry is put by
# default. Note that the <flag> value for that is 1. This should not
# be changed. However you can add other entries in new lines.
#
/event/session:   1

# Configure to not record folds with no balance impacts
/event/billing/cycle/fold:   0
