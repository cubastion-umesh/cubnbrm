# File:  SampleReload.pl
# Title: Utility reload script for sample batch handler
#
# Description:
#	This script calls the batch application to reprocess
#	input files.  Typically, this script is manually
#	executed after the user has corrected those error
#	records found by the batch application during an
#	earlier run.
#
# Note:
#	The scipt will sensibly handle the name of the input
#	file if "_cache.xml" was appended to the filename by
#	the earlier batch application run.  This reflects the
#	behavior of the UEL application.
#
#=============================================================
